# First Formik Form

This is a basic React form using Formik.

Users can input their name, email address, and password to log those values to the console.

Inputs are validated according to the following rules:
- name: must not be empty
- email address: must be in valid email format
- password: must not be empty

Inputs are validated after user clicks "Submit" so as not to interrupt entry.
